```python
def dict_compare(dict1, dict2):
    return bool
```

```
>>> a = {1: 'one', 2: {'two': [2, '2']}}
>>> b = {1: 'one', 2: {'two': [2, '2']}}
>>> dict_compare(a, b)
True
```

### Problem 2

```python
def number_to_word(number):
    return word
```

```python
>>> number(10001)
Ten Thousand and one
```


### Problem 3
